Released on 2020/08/10.

## Shiny new things

- Graph view now updates in real time when files are created/removed, or when links are changed.
- New "local" graph view bound to the file of the linked pane, similar to how backlinks and outline pane works. Use the "More options" menu to find the new "Open local graph" option.
- Obsidian is now translated to several different languages thanks to our lovely community members. This version comes with full support for English and 中文 (Chinese), and partial support for Deutsch, Français (French), русский (Russian) and Türkçe (Turkish). If you would like to help translate Obsidian to your native language, join our Discord `#translations` channel.
- The Slides plugin has been revamped and updated. It now works with image/audio/video embeds, LaTeX, code blocks and mermaid graphs.
- The Zettelkasten prefixer plugin now has a file template option.

## Changes

- Renaming folders now properly updates all affected links. Creating or renaming files that causes duplicate names will now update links to absolute links to avoid conflicts.
- Search performance has been improved. It will now match files much faster, where it was previously limited to 600 files per second.
- `<style>` tags are no longer permitted in raw HTML. This is because the HTML standard disallows `<style>` tags within `<body>`; they are only permitted in `<head>`.

## No longer broken

- Fixed switching from edit to preview mode has a brief flash before changes are applied.
- Editor no longer inserts an extra pair of `]]` closing brackets when "smart indent list" is turned off.
- Outline plugin no longer becomes and editor when switching to a media file.
- PDFs that used to have missing characters now renders properly.
