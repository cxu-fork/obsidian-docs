Released on 2020/08/24.

## Changes

- Hovering the unlink pane button now highlights the pane itself as well.

## No longer broken

- Clicking on a checkbox should check the correct box instead of the one 3 lines down, oops.
- Clicking an outline pane link would sometimes not work depending on pane configuration. That's fixed now.
